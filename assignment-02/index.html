    <div class="bodyText">
        <p>Will and Sophia told me we were going to the ocean. Snacks and a change of clothes in my backpack, I stretched a bit waiting outside my apartment before they picked me up in Will’s car. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Beavertail+State+Park/@41.4535106,-71.3975929,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x18de0411786e40d?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiB_pyj1c7vAhUTElkFHaWfDWcQ_BIwIXoECDgQBQ" target="_blank">Typing “Beavertail State Park” into Google Maps</a> to navigate us to the southern tip of Rhode Island, I prepared myself for an odyssey, my first encounter with the Atlantic. We made it to our destination on the southernmost tip of Conanticut Island on Narragansett Bay in less than thirty minutes. After living in Providence for a year, I never realized how the little river I heard at night outside my window contributed to something so much larger than itself, so near. I felt like a parent finding their child playing hooky in the mall. So this is where you go when you leave home? </p>

        <p>The Atlantic is not what I imagine when I think “ocean.” Seattle, my real home; the Pacific, the Ocean. Yet I realize I’ve barely even visited it. In Seattle, the Puget Sound <i>feels</i> as big as an ocean. I took the Pacific for granted. Even now, I fail in comprehending its scale. How do you convey how big an ocean is compared to a great bay when standing on the shore they look the same? Boarding the Washington State Ferries, a voyage so boring after years of visiting my parents in Bremerton, I barely register the Sound as I shuffle into a booth and fall asleep.</p>

        <p>From where I lived in Capitol Hill about 2 miles from the waterfront and 300 feet above sea level, I could see the water on my walks around the neighborhood while crossing streets that parted the trees and buildings. I can’t say I evers stopped to admire the view and even if I wanted to, I’d be standing in the middle of traffic.</p>

        <p>Before the city tore down the Alaskan Way Viaduct, the elevated highway that ran alongside the water through Downtown, I was riding in a car with my boss at the wheel when he said, “This view belongs to everyone.” Everyone seemed upset by the Viaduct’s impending demolition and yet it was the first time I had been on the viaduct because I don’t know how to drive.  I got around town on busses or underground aboard the light rail. I remember looking out the window while my boss kept his eyes on the road. It must have been a nice view.</p>

        <p>To be more specific, I was looking out at Elliott Bay, the expanse of water that embraces the west edge of the city, the name for the section of the Puget Sound lapping the Waterfront. Before I left Seattle, Fausto and I rode the ferris wheel on the water’s edge to make a ritual of our goodbye. Just sitting aboard the Great Seattle Wheel mattered more to me than the view, but you can only appreciate the water and not the vessel when you’re suspended in one of its carriages. That night it was too dark to really look out onto the water. A year later when I was playing The Last of Us: Part Two, I was a character sitting on the same ferris wheel while both virtual Seattle and the actual Seattle were on lockdown from different pandemics. Now that travel is limited, what do I even know about the place where I’ve lived most of my life? Half the names of things I’ve already mentioned I had to look up. How do you get to the ocean? I opened up a web browser to Google Maps and found myself back at the ferris wheel.</p>

        <p>With the waterfront as your starting point, if you were on a sailboat navigating the waters en route to the Pacific you would first travel north up the Puget Sound veering slightly west towards the setting sun. Eventually, with Port Townsend on your left and Whidbey Island on your right, the Sound would open up into the Salish Sea, a chamber of water as open as a sinus cavity. Travelling on Google Maps gives you an omniscient perspective, distance reduced to scanning text on screen. The names of minor bays and tributaries along the way remind me of Circe by Madeline Miller. What minor gods and goddesses tended these inlets and coves, ignored for grander bodies of water? On the Google Maps interface, their names appear only past a certain zoom threshold as if the user wills the world into being. I wonder how every bay figures in its local imagination, if the people who live on the water have their own names not captured by satellite imagery. What names are erased by history and human conquest? In what stories and legends are these waters named after heroes or villains? Of the names present on screen, I see indigenous languages, names of colonizers, and simple descriptions. Sequim Bay. Fort Casey. Mutiny Bay. What happened there? I see Point No Point, where I spent summers with friends in high school. Is that how far north it is? Another obscure distance made mysterious by my lack of a driver’s license. Above a certain scale a map is useless for a pedestrian, god and human vision impossible for the other to comprehend.</p>

        <p>As I sit across the country on a different coast scrutinizing landmarks online, I realize my nostalgia is a romantic hypothetical. As a city boy, an indoor kid, I never got out too much, if at all. My friends once took me to a lake and the only footwear I owned were a pair of Doc Martens I wore on the wet sand, frowning on a log watching my friends swim in the shallow water. I can’t even imagine actually making this journey if I ever returned. So much of what I know is only second-hand knowledge. I receive the world more than I make my way through it.</p>

        <p>While plotting this imaginary voyage and scanning the Salish Sea, I’m reminded of Sony’s 2018 Playstation 4 reboot of God of War. In the game, you traverse the Lake of the Nine, the central hub with different story beats branching out in every direction. The Spartan warrior who ascended to godhood, Kratos, has since been displaced in the land of the Norse gods. In his adventure, he and the player learn new mythologies inscribed into the geography itself. You travel the world in third person, the camera above Kratos’s shoulder in the simulation of a single shot camera take. Pausing the game brings you to the world map. God’s-eye view for the god’s eye. Whose vision is this? The game world is a book you learn to read.</p>

        <p>Back in this reality, as you sail out into the Salish Sea, Canada is to the north, of course. It’s where I was supposed to be all of August when the borders closed like a checkpoint in an RPG. In Pokémon, a slumbering Snorlax blocks your path until you retrieve the Pokéflute and wake it up. When I think of journeys, I imagine where I’ve wandered in digital spaces. I remember the fields of Hyrule, the desecration of post-apocalyptic Tokyo in the Shin Megami Tensei series, the wilderness of The Witcher. Beyond roadtrips where I sat staring out of windows while others navigated highways and exits, my travelling is limited to areas around the hub of airport terminals. Subways tend towards the subterranean and graphic designers plotting these paths on maps can abstract their twists and turns along simple lines with notches for different stops along their routes.</p>

        <p>While tracing sea routes in Seattle from Providence, my friends back home sent me photos of their camping trip on Cranberry Lake Campground at Deception Pass, a public grounds on the eastern shores of the Salish Sea. I saved their group photo at night along the beach and set it as my iPhone wallpaper. They crowd together, maskless after each receiving negative COVID tests, and smile bigly for the camera. They look so small in the heroic portrait of evening. Taking up the majority of the picture, the night sky is alight with stars. A few weeks ago, my new friends in Providence and I sat on a rooftop as we watched the heavens anticipating the Perseid meteor shower. Like the Europeans whose names brand the new world, classic Greek and Roman mythology laid claim to the language I learned to describe the heavens.</p>

        <p>From what we read in the local news, at its peak nearly 100 shooting stars would streak across the sky per hour. We realized too late that the optimal viewing time was at 4 AM but we stayed up until 2 anyway, enjoying each other’s company watching the clouds pass to reveal pockets of deep, clear black. Only one or two of us saw a shooting star that night. I wore my glasses outside for the first time in a long time and I was shocked that I could see the red pinhole of Mars, as clear as if it were a camera apparatus about to take an exposure. Somehow a city as small as Providence still drowned the night sky in light pollution. The few stars I saw above are another fathomless distance. Its humbling to confront what ought to be a nightly reminder of my smallness in the vastness of the universe. Humans manipulating light in the darkness grow bolder and we forget our place in the design. After staring upwards for a few hours, we realized our eyes had adjusted to the dark and we could see each other perfectly, almost as if it were day. “I can see you!” we exclaimed, seeing each other anew.</p>

        <p>I remember a fragment of a phrase I wrote down when I was in my poetry program in Rome. I think I lifted it off the didactic panels at a museum or from a Keats reference: imaginative travel. Charting journeys on Google Maps, staring into the night sky looking for meteors, a canceled flight booking in my email inbox, and countries banning foreign citizens from entering their borders out of risk of infection—imaginative travel is all I have these days.</p>

        <p>When I was a kid, my family took a ferry to Victoria and I remember it was either early morning or late evening with a big black sky. The boat rocked back and forth so much I thought we would capsize. The only other notable memory happened during the border crossing back to the States. I watched my Uncle and Auntie, two naturalized American citizens, fumble their answers to the basic questions of where they lived and how they were doing, answering them out of sync. How are you? What? Where do you live? Fine. Back then, my cousins and I laughed and laughed but now when I get scrutinized for the last name on my passport, I remember the way my Auntie rubbed my Uncle’s back as he stammered to correct himself. We lived in America. We still do.</p>

        <p>I don’t mean to linger at sea. Back to the journey to the Pacific. Continue westward on the Salish and you’ll sail between Vancouver Island on your right, and the Olympic Peninsula on your left. The Strait of Juan de Fuca. Two “of’s” in two different languages. Speaking of possession it seems there’s a spot on the southern tip of Whidbey Island actually named Possession. Seems awfully romantic. Or dark, depending on what possesses you most. Clicking on it reveals no answers. But anyway that’s back down South and we’ve given up on visiting it already.</p>

        <p>Juan de Fuca was born Ioannis Phokas, a Greek sailor in service to the King of Spain, Philip II, the same king conquistadors named a collection of Southeast Asian islands after. Juan de Fuca made his mark by voyaging to the Pacific Northwest. In the land of 29 federally-recognized indigenous tribes (and there are more and there were more)  Juan de Fuca claimed to have discovered the Strait of Anián, a mythical body of water said to grant access to the Northwest Passage, another hypothetical sea route suggested by speculative cartographers of the era connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific across the New World. Imaginative travel. Of course, there is no Northwest Passage and for a while researchers examining the Spanish colonial archives found no evidence of Juan de Fuca himself, rendering him as fictional as the strait he supposedly discovered. It was the British captain, Charles William Barkley, who named the Strait of Juan de Fuca in 1787 after its seeming similarities to the Strait of Anián. In 1859, on the eve of the American Civil War, American scholars were able to prove Juan de Fuca’s existence in the official record, but not the veracity of his legendary voyages. If there was a name for this body of water before colonization, I cannot find it. According to native-land.ca, the lands along the strait are home to the Klallam, Coast Salish, Pacheedaht, Makah, Te’mexw, and Lekwungen/Songhees peoples, and surely others.</p>

        <p>As I imagine sailing along the strait, I’m stunned by its enormity: twice the width of the whole of Seattle if set lengthwise side by side then turned 90 degrees. On your sailboat, would you know you were on a path to the ocean or would you mistake yourself as there already? Rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans are as borderless as the land but maps fail to tell me when one body of water ends and another begins. Estuaries mark where fresh and saltwater mix, but beyond that, how do you know if you’ve crossed over from one name to another?</p>

        <p>The last time I touched the Pacific Ocean, I was on a vacation to the Oregon Coast. I remember it now only in photographs, a trip marred by the heartache that happened not long after the trip was over. I remember it was a grey day on the beach and I had only brought clothes better suited to tropical beaches of my youth. I remember one photo where I’m wrapped in a blanket with my boyfriend like a burrito on the sand. In Bremerton, where I spent most of my childhood, my family and I would go crabbing, oyster harvesting, and sit along the docks at the Silverdale Waterfront overlooking Dyes Inlet. It’s not like I didn’t already know that beaches in the Pacific Northwest were different—colder, rockier, moodier somehow—but those beaches were along the Puget Sound. Maybe I thought since it was a more southern part of the Pacific, the beach would resemble the sandy cradles I grew up with in Hawaii or California. It would be a reunion. And why not? Wasn’t this the same ocean that delivered a bloom of jellyfish around us when my cousins and I swam together in the Philippines? What was the name of that beach? What were its other, older names? What is its name it will never reveal?</p>

        <p>The Pacific and Atlantic oceans feel like polar opposites to me, two kingdoms ruled over by two warring gods with unique and complementary temperaments. I’ve lived my entire adult life along the Ring of Fire up until a year ago. The Pacific feels like home—more nostalgic, more romantic. I am attuned to it in the sense that it has always served as a potential journey, a story I tell myself for each of those locations, that I could visit it if only I wanted to put in the effort. Like all things grown too familiar I treated the ocean with neglect and comforted myself in the story of its ceaseless possibility. Here in Providence, the Atlantic carries with it too much baggage. Detritus. The sins and atrocities of the old world are sunken at the bottom. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge rips the world in half along its seam. In my imagination the Atlantic is colder, more ruthless, the ocean of old sea shanties, legendary malice, and violent trade. But I’m being unfair. Susceptible to home-ocean bias. The oceans are really just one big ocean.</p>

        <p>Over the past few months, the story of Bas Jan Ader has been pressing up against me, retold and delivered in different formats as if an algorithm knew exactly what I wanted to know before I knew it myself. I first heard about the artist when Jack Halberstam mentioned his work while lecturing on auto-destructive art in a video uploaded onto YouTube. Next, he was featured in a catalogue book for the exhibition “Getting Emotional” at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston. Now, in The Crying Book, Heather Christle references his work and his tragedy, reminding me of how aligned his art and my interests are. These sources mention three of his projects. In his Fall series, Ader staged dramatic falls to the earth. Videos document his various falls: from standing on the ground, off of roofs while sitting in a chair, and in one instance, Ader hangs from a tree and falls into a canal in Holland (what canal?). In his series of videos and photographs, I’m too sad to tell you, Ader weeps with no explanation in front of a camera. His last work, In Search of the Miraculous, Ader “set sail in a little boat stupidly to cross the Atlantic and never returned.” He went missing on this voyage and never completed the three-part work, the Atlantic journey that began at the Hook of Holland bookended by two night wanderings in different cities equipped with only a flashlight. I can’t help but compare his last series to a video game. The world map pocked with markers for abandoned quests and unvisited points of interest. What was Ader looking for? What was there to tell? His boat was found wrecked off the coast of Ireland (what coast?). His body was never recovered, and in a sense the world is always in search for traces of him.</p>

        <p>Sophia is leaving for Germany soon. I asked her if she wanted to touch the Atlantic Ocean while we were at Beavertail State Park so she could touch the same water when she was back home in Europe and remember our day together. I watched her and Will tease towards the water’s edge but the park was more cliffside than beach and I don’t know if they made contact. I had another opportunity to appreciate the ocean and I sat on the hill and read a book about it instead. Squirming under the shade of a tree where we set down our blankets, I watched them like they were kids playing at the seashore. I held my book in my hand, my fingers keeping my place and days later the book still opens up to that page on its own as if it, too, remembers that day. I remember the final scene at the end of Portrait of a Lady on Fire and I think about what imaginative travel means when distances are too great and no one can travel at all. The people we love might as well be on Mars, at the bottom of the ocean, in their images we carry with us in our pockets.</p>

        <p>When will I see my friend again? I will never come back to this shore.</p>
