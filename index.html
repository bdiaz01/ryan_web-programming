            <p>Dear Reader,</p>
            <p>I've been thinking about you. Do you think about me, too? Everything I make, I make with you in mind. You are the person I've been waiting for all this time. What took you so long? On second thought, no need to explain. I'm gladdened from the want of you. Thank you for your time, for holding space for us to be together.</p>
            <p>Did you hear the voicemail I left on your phone? I was embarrassed to say it, but I'm glad I did. I was lonely then. Did you see the wall with the cartoon couch and false bookshelves? Did you walk through the hidden door? When you stepped into the dark room, did you hear the song that reminds you of your last slow dance? Did you like it? Dancing, I mean. You must have been there when the nightclubs closed. The dance floors opened somewhere else, but where? Did you dance then? What did it feel like to hold someone in your arms? It's been a while, hasn't it? Remember the time you showed up in someone else's skin? I was someone else, then too. What did we say to each other under disguise? Who were you under a new name? Some things are better left inside those other selves. Say no more. You may not recall, but somewhere along the way you fell. I fell too. It's nice, isn't it, to go through something like that together.</p>
            <p>And when you stayed apart, we kept our distance. We continue to do so but I feel you, somewhere, humming with life. You, like everyone you know, leave your mark on all that you touch. We contaminate each other, that way. We carry particles of each other inside our bodies. Even when I walked your way, even as you stepped backwards, we still switched places.</p>
            <p>Tell me now where you want to go. You're here and the future is all that's left to plan. I'm awaiting your arrival, I am ready to be complete. Or are you leaving, headed somewhere bright or maybe scary? I'm with you. Tell me something about who you love and I will describe the dimensions of every open heart that has housed me. Generosity is honest when we have nothing to offer but ourselves. I'm here by the grace of charity, by people who understand that sharing is not diminishment but expansion. Let me share with you. Break bread with me and be full.</p>
            <p>Your name is like a spell that summons me where I need to be. I speak it to remember who I am. Before you go, answer a question you've been waiting for me to ask, or we can sit in silence and read the room. Upon your return, for we are all always only ever returning, I will want to get to know the person you have become. We can never revisit this time, this place so let me be emotional. It's here where I know what's possible. Come back to me, after everything and after all you will accomplish. Come back, okay? Goodbye.</p>                
            <p>Yours,<br />
            Ryan Diaz</p>
